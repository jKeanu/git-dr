Some description!

## Subheader

You have two branches: your current local branch (let's call it feature) and the main branch on the remote repository (GitHub).

When you run git merge main on your local branch (feature), Git fetches the latest changes from the main branch on GitHub and tries to merge them into your feature branch.

If there are no conflicts, Git automatically applies the changes from the remote main branch to your local feature branch. The feature branch now contains the changes from the remote main branch.

At this point, your local feature branch has been updated with the changes from the remote main branch, but the actual main branch in your local repository remains unchanged.

If you want to update the main branch in your local repository to match the remote main branch (GitHub), you need to do a separate update, either by checking out the main branch and pulling the latest changes or by running git pull origin main while on the main branch.

After updating your local main branch, you can also push the changes to the remote repository to synchronize the main branch on GitHub with the updated local main branch.

Remember that git merge main affects your current local branch, not the main branch in the remote repository. To update the remote main branch, you need to push the changes from your local feature branch (which now includes the merged changes) to the remote main branch.
